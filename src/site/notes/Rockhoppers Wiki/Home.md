The year is 2321. Humans have spread to the farthest corners of the Solar System. There are cities in the clouds of Venus, along the canyon walls of Mars, amid the rings of Saturn, and in the inky black of the Kuiper Belt.

But Earth itself is a dying world. Three centuries of uncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions have let loose the fastest mass extinction event in the planet's history. Once-vibrant oceans are sterile. Once-fertile farmland has withered. Whole nations have been devoured by the steady advance of sand and sea.

The survivorsâ€™ vow to rebuild has taken life in the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Organizations/Restitution Project\|Restitution Project]]. Simultaneously a world government, an economic system, an infrastructure effort, and a cultural north star, the Restitution Project purports to be the single voice of all humanity, working in unison toward one noble goal: save Earth.

The reality is, of course, more complicated.
