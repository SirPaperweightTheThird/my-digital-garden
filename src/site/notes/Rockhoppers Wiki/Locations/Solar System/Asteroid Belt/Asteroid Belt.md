# Asteroid Belt
#Solar_System #Asteroid_Belt

The [Asteroid Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt) is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, centered on the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Sun\|Sun]] and roughly spanning the space between the orbits of the planets [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Jupiter/Jupiter\|Jupiter]] and [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Mars/Mars\|Mars]]. It contains a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The identified objects are of many sizes, but much smaller than planets, and, on average, are about one million kilometers (or six hundred thousand miles) apart. About 60% of the Asteroid Belt's mass is contained in the four largest asteroids: [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Asteroid Belt/Ceres\|Ceres]], Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the Asteroid Belt is estimated to be 3% that of [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Earth/Luna\|Luna]].

Humans first arrived in the Asteroid Belt in the early 22nd century, participating in private asteroid mining ventures and scientific voyages. The [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Organizations/Restitution Project\|Restitution Project]] founded [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Settlements/Asteroid Belt/Yamakawa City\|Yamakawa City]] as a permanent administrative colony on Ceres, bringing the region under its nominal authority. However, the Asteroid Belt remained too large and too distant for effective Restitutionary control, and power remained in local hands.

The advent of fusion rocketry in the early 23rd century made the Asteroid Belt far more accessible to the Inner Planets. Settlement of the Belt grew rapidly, largely in unregulated, privately-owned stations. The founding of the External Service in 2250 coincided with a rationalization and centralization of Restitutionary authority. In 2278, Ceres' Spacer-run local government was replaced with a Restitutionary central committee staffed by Earthers.

Mining and manufacturing are the major industries of the Asteroid Belt. Ceres in particular is a hub for commercial activity, exporting raw materials and manufactured goods to the Inner Planets, and supplying colonial missions to the Outer Planets. Although large corporations have expanded their hold over the Belt in the last century, individual mining crews are still common. Piracy and claim jumping are frequent dangers.
