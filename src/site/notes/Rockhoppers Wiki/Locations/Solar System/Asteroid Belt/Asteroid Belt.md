#Solar_System #Asteroid_Belt

The [Asteroid Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt) is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, centered on the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Sun\|Sun]] and roughly spanning the space between the orbits of the planets [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Jupiter/Jupiter\|Jupiter]] and [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Mars/Mars\|Mars]]. It contains a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The identified objects are of many sizes, but much smaller than planets, and, on average, are about one million kilometers (or six hundred thousand miles) apart. About 60% of the Asteroid Belt's mass is contained in the four largest asteroids: [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Asteroid Belt/Ceres\|Ceres]], Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the Asteroid Belt is estimated to be 3% that of [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Earth/Luna\|Luna]].
