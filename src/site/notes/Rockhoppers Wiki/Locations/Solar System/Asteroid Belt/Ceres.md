# Ceres
#Solar_System #Asteroid_Belt 

[Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)) is a dwarf planet in the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Asteroid Belt/Asteroid Belt\|Asteroid Belt]] between the orbits of [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Mars/Mars\|Mars]] and [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Jupiter/Jupiter\|Jupiter]]. It was the first asteroid discovered, on 1 January 1801, by Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo Astronomical Observatory in Sicily and announced as a new planet. Ceres was later classified as an asteroid and then a dwarf planet, the only one always inside [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Neptune\|Neptune]]'s orbit.
