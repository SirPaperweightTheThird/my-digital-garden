# Earth
#Solar_System #Earth 

[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) is the third planet from the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Sun\|Sun]] and the only astronomical object known to naturally harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's surface. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain significant quantities of water.

As of 2300, 7.25 billion people live on Earth's surface, or about 45.8% of the human population. Another 8.51 billion people live on stations in Earth's orbit and Hill sphere, including the [[Orbital Ring\|Orbital Ring]], an artificial superstructure encircling the planet's equator. Combined, Earth and its orbital stations account for 99.4% of the human population.

Starting in the 19th century, human industrial activity has driven a steady increase in Earth's global average temperature, significantly affecting the planet's climate system and biosphere. Known as the Climate Crisis, these changes include ocean acidification, melting permafrost, sea level rise, desertification, and land degradation. The Climate Crisis has precipitated a global collapse in biodiversity, food security, and access to fresh water, as well as a widespread expulsion of humans into outer space starting in the 22nd century.

Earth is unified under the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Organizations/Restitution Project\|Restitution Project]], a supranational governing body responsible for reversing the effects of anthropogenic climate change, including the Holocene extinction. Earth is further subdivided into various sovereign states, but since the 22nd century, their governing authority has slowly been superseded by that of the Restitution Project.
