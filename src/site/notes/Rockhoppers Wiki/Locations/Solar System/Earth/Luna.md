#Solar_System #Earth

[Luna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) is [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Earth/Earth\|Earth]]'s only natural satellite and orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30 times Earth's diameter. Luna's near side always faces Earth because, being tidally locked, it rotates exactly once per orbit. A lunar day is 29.5 Earth days long, and its gravitational influence is the main driver of Earth's tides.
