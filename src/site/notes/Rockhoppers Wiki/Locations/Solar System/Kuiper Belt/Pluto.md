# Pluto
#Solar_System #Kuiper_Belt 

[Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Kuiper Belt/Kuiper Belt\|Kuiper Belt]], a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Neptune\|Neptune]]. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Sun\|Sun]]. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper Belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has only one sixth the mass of [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Earth/Luna\|Luna]], and one third its volume.
