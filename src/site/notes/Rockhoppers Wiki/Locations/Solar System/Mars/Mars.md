# Mars
#Solar_System 

[Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars) is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Sun\|Sun]]. The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". Mars's radius is second smallest among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5 km (2,106 mi). The Martian dichotomy is visible on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars's northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than its southern hemisphere. Mars has a thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide and two irregularly shaped natural satellites: [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Mars/Phobos\|Phobos]] and [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Mars/Deimos\|Deimos]].
