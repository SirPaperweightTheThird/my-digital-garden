# Mercury

[Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)) is the first planet from the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Sun\|Sun]] and the smallest in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to overlapping impact events. These features are well preserved since the planet has no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere. Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Earth/Earth\|Earth]], Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Mars/Mars\|Mars]]. Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites.
