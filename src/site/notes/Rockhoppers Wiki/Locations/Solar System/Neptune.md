#Solar_System 

[Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune) is the eighth planet from the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Sun\|Sun]] and the farthest recognized planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Earth/Earth\|Earth]], and slightly more massive than its near-twin [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Uranus\|Uranus]]. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at a distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometers; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, representing Neptune's trident.
