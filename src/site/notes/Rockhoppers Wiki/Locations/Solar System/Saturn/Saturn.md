#Solar_System 

[Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn) is the sixth planet from the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Sun\|Sun]] and the second-largest in the Solar System, after [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Jupiter/Jupiter\|Jupiter]]. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Earth/Earth\|Earth]]. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. The planet has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust.
