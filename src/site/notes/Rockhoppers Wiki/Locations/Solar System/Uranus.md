# Uranus
#Solar_System 

[Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus) is the seventh planet from the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Sun\|Sun]] and is a gaseous cyan ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 97.8° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Earth/Earth\|Earth]] years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.
