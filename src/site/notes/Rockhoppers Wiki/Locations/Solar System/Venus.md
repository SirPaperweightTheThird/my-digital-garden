# Venus

[Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus) is the second planet from the [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Sun\|Sun]]. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbor [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Earth/Earth\|Earth]]. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a "morning star" or an "evening star". While this is also true for [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Mercury\|Mercury]], Venus appears much more prominently, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun, appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet or any fixed star. With such prominence in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.
