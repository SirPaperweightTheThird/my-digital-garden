The Restitution Project is an intergovernmental organization whose stated purposes are to halt the process of anthropogenic climate change, to protect [[Rockhoppers Wiki/Locations/Solar System/Earth/Earth\|Earth]]'s biosphere, and to preserve the planet's livable environment for future generations. To these ends, the Restitution Project engages in planetary engineering or terraforming, deliberately modifying the planet's atmosphere, temperature, surface topography, and ecology using resources extracted from across the Solar System. In the 24th century, the Restitution Project is widely understood to be a world government, with jurisdictional authority superseding all sovereign states.
